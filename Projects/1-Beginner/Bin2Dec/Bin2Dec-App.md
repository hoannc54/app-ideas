# Bin2Dec
2
​
3
**Tier:** 1-Beginner
4
​
5
Binary is the number system all digital computers are based on.
6
Therefore it's important for developers to understand binary, or base 2,
7
mathematics. The purpose of Bin2Dec is to provide practice and
8
understanding of how binary calculations.
9
​
10
Bin2Dec allows the user to enter strings of up to 8 binary digits, 0's
11
and 1's, in any sequence and then displays its decimal equivalent.
12
​
13
This challenge requires that the developer implementing it follow these
14
constraints:
15
​
16
-   Arrays may not be used to contain the binary digits entered by the user
17
-   Determining the decimal equivalent of a particular binary digit in the
18
    sequence must be calculated using a single mathematical function, for
19
    example the natural logarithm. It's up to you to figure out which function
20
    to use.
